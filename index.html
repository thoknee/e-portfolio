            <h1> Background: </h1>
            <p> I am currently a sophomore studying computer science and math at Boston 
                Univeristy. I was born and raised in Washington State, 
                but always found myself wanting to see and explore more of the country, 
                part of the reason I decided to travel all the way across the 
                country to Boston. 
            </p>
            <p> Computer science has always intriguied me since I was a little kid. My dad 
                taught himself all the coding knowledge he has today and currently does a 
                lot of work with web development. A lot of my curiousity comes from my dad
                as I would continually ask him questions and he would always be able to answer.
                It is thanks to him that I find myself so interested in computer science and 
                the heaby depth that comes with this field of science.

            <h1> Some other info about me:</h1>
            <p> Another huge reason that I chose Boston University was because
                I was given an oppurtunity to swim on the University's swim team.
                This has turned into one of the most positive experiences of my life 
                as swimming has always created an extremely positive structure for me. 
                On top of that, the friends and connections that I have made on the team
                are some of the most important in my life.
            </p>
            <p> Outside of swimming, I really enjoy hanging out with friends and playing
                video games. Game development has always heavily intriguied me and something
                that I have worked on myself over time. Currently, game dev is my favorite part
                of computer science as I feel it encomopasses so much of the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, my goal with computer science is to make the world a better place.
                If something that I can create or help create can make someones life easier, 
                more enjoyable, or more interesting than I would have found myself successful
                in one way or another.

            <p> Over the summer, a tiktok trend came about ordering things 
                without knowing what comes next. The tiktok filter would 
                give you a random food, sports player, restuarant, etc. 
                and you would rank it 1-5 without knowing what the next 
                thing will be creating a fun game to play. With things 
                like food and sports players, this was pretty subjective
                 as some people would prefer certain foods and other people 
                 would prefer something else. So, people started doing it 
                 with numbers where you would try to order 5,10, and finally 
                 20 numbers numerically without knowing the numbers that 
                 will come next.
            </p>

            <p> Unhappy with the tiktok filter/interface I decided to code a simple
                javascript version that is more accessible,easier to use, and more intuitive.
                It isn't anything terribly special, but it was a cool little side project
                to work on over the summer.

            <p>As the game continues, boxes turn red if your current number
                can't go there. This continues until you fill all 20 and win,
                or your number can't go anywhere and you lose.
